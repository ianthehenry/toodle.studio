Hello and thank you for coming to my website.

# About

My name is [Ian Henry](https://ianthehenry.com), and this is a little toy that I've been working on.

I made this as an example app for a book I'm writing about the [Janet programming language](https://janet-lang.org).

If you like this, check out my much-more-interesting art playground [Bauble](https://bauble.studio)!
